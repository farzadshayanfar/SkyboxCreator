# SkyboxCreator
A Unity gui tool for downloading and creating cubic Skybox materials by providing
a file containing a list of hdri image uris. This was one in a series of 
Utilities developed for a neuroscience research project.

# Usage
Please use the .unitypackage file in the releases to import this tool into Unity.
Then, you can find *SkyboxCreator* under *Tools* menu. There are two input fields that 
need to be filled. One accepts the path to a text file whose every line is the URI of
an hdri file. The second field, is the path to an existing directory inside the Assets
folder of a Unity project (it is imperative that the output folder be inside the asset
folder of a Unity project). This is where the downloaded hdri files and the generated
cubic skybox materials are stored.
